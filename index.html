        <h3>Hello. Welcome to CodeSync.org</h3>
        <p>by <a href="pages/author.html">Sean Stafford</a></p>
        <p>Let me first start with explaining the purpose of CodeSync.org:<br /><br />
        <em>The purpose of this website is to promote, consolidate, and reward projects 
        and individual game/software developers which decide to affix a GNU General Public 
        License to their code.</em><br/><br />

        This site provides two non-discriminating lists of GPL-licensed material, 
    	one for MMO games and another for game development software.<br /><br />

        <em>"What does MMO stand for?"</em><br /><br />
        
        MMO stands for Mass-Multiplayer Online.<br /><br />

        You might ask, <em>"Why only MMO games?"</em><br /><br />
        
        Simply put, they are the most time consuming of all 
        games to make, generally require the largest teams, and must be maintained 
        when they are finished.<br /><br />

        MMOs are also rather expensive to make under a GPL license, because many developers 
        and administrators make little to no money off of the games which they host. The people who devote themselves
        to such a task deserve some extra recognition in my opinion.<br /><br />

        Additionally, in order to make it worth their time and money to keep their game servers online, they need
        a good amount of players on them and generally don't have the money for advertisement campaigns in contrast to
        their proprietary counterparts.<br /><br />

        There are many GPL-licensed games out there that are fantastic but    
        will not fit my criteria for MMO and they simply won't be mentioned in the list. If you
        know a game that fits my criteria and is not on the list already, please let me know through
        email. My email address is located on the 'About Me' page.     
        </p>
        <br />
